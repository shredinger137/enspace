Users could enter miles covered on a given date, unlocking achievement badges and, for some participants, showing progress on a leaderboard. Global stats, including distance covered by all participants added together, were also provided. Over 1,000 registrations were recorded, and total distance added up to nearly circumnavigating the Earth twice. This tracker is now being expanded into a general purpose tool, https://trexa.me, that allows other teams to host their own marathons.",
